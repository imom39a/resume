Graduated from crescent engineering college, India (2006-2010) at age of 21 and started my carier with iGate Global Solutions which is now part of Capgemini.

I started my earlie carier as a Java programer working with Spring, Struts, IBM WebSphere Portlet and JSP. Around early 2014 I found my way into hybrid mobile app development since then I have been working as a full stack developer focusing more on advanced java scripts, objective C, Java, OSGI, micro services and more.

Recently I have been an javascript enthusiast and want to be active part of the open source movement.
